    <p>The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal in<b> August 1947</b>  at the time of partition of India, when the region became East Pakistan as a part of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan.[21] Later the rise of a pro-democracy movement thrived on Bengali nationalism and self-determination, leading to the Liberation War and eventually resulted in the emergence of<strong>Bangladesh as a sovereign</strong>  and independent nation in 1971.</p>
